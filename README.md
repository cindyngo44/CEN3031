# Spring 2022 CEN3031 Project - Sesh
Our project involves a study habit tracker which details the user’s daily
activity and statistically computes how often the user keeps up with a
specific habit. The study habit tracker stores the user’s statistics using their
usernames and passwords as identifiers. We will create a competitive
environment by implementing a leaderboard which allows users to
participate in a highly motivating workspace.

# Challenge 
Due to the consequences of the global pandemic that we are currently
experiencing, we noticed that it is difficult to find virtual study environments.
While addressing that problem,we also wanted to build this habit tracker to
motivate students to persistently keep up with their goals. We want to create a fun
atmosphere that mirrors a gaming environment that inspires students to persevere
and accomplish their ambitions while engaging in healthy competition with their
peers. Having an application that includes a leaderboard and a point system may
further help with keeping students incentivized.
