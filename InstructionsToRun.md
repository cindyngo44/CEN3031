# Instructions for running Sesh CEN3031 project
This project is a react project that uses npm dependencies so you will need to have node.js installed but once you have that it should be fairly simple.

## Download Node.js
If you do not already have node.js installed you can find it [here.](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

## Clone this repository
Clone this repository to your computer and open up the file within your IDE

## Open two terminals
Make sure you have two terminals up and running. 

## Navigate into my-app(Frontend) - 1st Terminal
Using the first terminal navigate into the "my-app" folder, if you open the repository in VScode you should just need to use the command "cd my-app".

# Navigate into the signupbackend (Backend) - 2nd Terminal

## Website
Our frontend website is deployed using Netlify and can be accessed [here](https://glittery-bienenstitch-06fdd7.netlify.app/). Currently, our backend is a work-in-progress, so users will not be able to login. We recommend you follow the steps listed above to access the whole site (user authentication and all).
